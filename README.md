# Notes + Snippets
As of January 2026, still deciding whether or not it's worth it to migrate all my snippets and little scripts to here from another github account and other git repos (hosted  - my domain)

## Local Scripts (shell, etc.)

### Daily Git (Bitbucket) repo report - checks local repos for uncommitted changes, gets log of changes

### Daily report of Slack reminders in pretty format

### Daily, detailed Jira report
Checks user's assigned issues, watched issues, get's list with basic info, AND for linked issues, gets updates. 
todo: get user mentions
